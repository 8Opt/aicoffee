# Code of Conduct

This code of conduct outlines expectations for all members contributing to this project, including developers, designers, documenters, and testers.  Adhering to these guidelines helps create a positive and productive environment for everyone.

## 1. Our Pledge

In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we as contributors and maintainers pledge to making participation in our project and our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

## 2. Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to creating a positive environment include:

*   Using welcoming and inclusive language
*   Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
*   Gracefully accepting constructive criticism
*   Focusing on what is best for the community
*   Showing empathy towards other community members

Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include:

*   The use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or advances
*   Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
*   Public or private harassment
*   Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or electronic address, without explicit permission
*   Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting


## 3.  Naming Conventions

Consistent naming conventions are essential for maintaining a clean and readable codebase.  Adhere to the following standards:

*   **Variables and Functions:**  Use descriptive names in `snake_case` (lowercase with underscores). Examples: `user_name`, `calculate_total`, `process_image`.
*   **Constants:** Use `UPPER_SNAKE_CASE` for constants. Examples: `MAX_VALUE`, `API_KEY`.
*   **Classes:** Use `CamelCase` (capitalize the first letter of each word). Examples: `ImageProcessor`, `DataHandler`.
*   **Files:** Use `snake_case` for file names.  Examples: `image_utils.py`, `data_processing.py`.
*   **Modules:** Use short, all-lowercase names for modules. Examples: `utils`, `models`, `views`.
*   Be consistent with abbreviations and acronyms. Choose either all uppercase or all lowercase (e.g., `HTTP_STATUS` or `http_status`, but not `HttpStatus`).
*   Avoid single-character variable names except for simple counters or iterators (e.g., `i`, `j`, `k`).


## 4. Our Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, or to ban temporarily or permanently any contributor for other behaviors that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.
